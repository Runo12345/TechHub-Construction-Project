# 4. Identifying Activities and Their Sequence

In this phase, the project scope and WBS are decomposed into specific, actionable activities. Each activity is sequenced logically to reflect real-world construction dependencies and regulatory requirements.

## Key Activity Sequencing Logic
- Architectural and engineering designs must be completed and approved before procurement and construction can begin.
- Regulatory approvals and permits must be secured before site preparation and groundworks.
- Structural construction must precede internal systems installations such as electrical, plumbing, and HVAC.
- Testing and inspections must be completed before final handover.

## High-Level Activity Sequence
1. Requirements Finalization & Scope Approval  
2. Architectural & Engineering Design  
3. Regulatory Approvals & Permits  
4. Contractor and Vendor Procurement  
5. Site Preparation  
6. Foundation Works  
7. Structural Construction  
8. External Building Works  
9. Internal Systems Installation  
10. Testing, Inspections & Commissioning  
11. Final Handover & Project Closure  

This sequencing forms the basis for the project schedule and Gantt chart development in Smartsheet.

# 5. Determining Activity Durations

Activity durations are estimated based on:
- Project complexity
- Industry-standard construction timelines
- Availability of skilled labor and materials
- Potential risks such as weather delays or supply chain disruptions

## Duration Estimation Approach
- Planning and design activities are estimated using expert judgment and benchmark data from similar projects.
- Construction activities are estimated using bottom-up estimation, considering task size and resource intensity.
- Buffer time is included for high-risk activities such as regulatory approvals and inspections.

These duration estimates will later be refined and baselined during schedule development in Smartsheet.

# 6. Determining Resource Requirements and Balancing the Schedule

This step focuses on identifying the resources required for each activity and ensuring they are allocated efficiently to avoid bottlenecks or overallocation.

## Resource Categories
- **Labor:** Project managers, architects, engineers, construction workers, electricians, plumbers, safety officers  
- **Materials:** Concrete, steel, glass, electrical components, HVAC systems, interior finishes  
- **Equipment:** Excavators, cranes, scaffolding, power tools, safety equipment  

## Resource Balancing Strategy
- Critical resources are reviewed to ensure they are not assigned to overlapping activities beyond capacity.
- Construction phases are staggered to optimize labor usage.
- Procurement timelines are aligned with construction needs to avoid idle labor or material shortages.

Resource loading and leveling will be implemented during execution using Smartsheet’s resource management and scheduling tools.

## Notes
- This activity definition and sequencing serves as the foundation for the project Gantt chart.
- Baselines will be established once durations, dependencies, and resources are finalized in Smartsheet.
