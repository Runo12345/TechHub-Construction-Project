# 5. Determining Activity Durations

In this phase, estimated durations are assigned to each activity identified in the Work Breakdown Structure. These estimates are developed to reflect realistic construction timelines and practical constraints.

## Duration Estimation Considerations
Activity durations are determined based on:
- The complexity and scope of each task  
- Availability and productivity of required resources  
- Dependencies between activities  
- External factors such as regulatory approvals, weather conditions, and supply chain risks  

## Estimation Approach
- **Planning and design activities** are estimated using expert judgment and reference data from similar construction projects.
- **Construction activities** are estimated using bottom-up estimation, breaking work into smaller tasks and aggregating their durations.
- **Contingency buffers** are included for high-risk or uncertain activities to reduce schedule overruns.

These duration estimates will be reviewed and refined during schedule development and will be baselined once approved in Smartsheet.
